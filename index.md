## DiVe
   Many of the vending machines that we use today are evolving. Our goal is to make 
   the transactions and dispensing items more convenient by changing the two 
   biggest disadvantages of traditional machine - Cash based payment and customer 
   not getting the ordered item because it got stuck. First highlight point of our project 
   is the digitalisation of the payment system, our new product will allow payment 
   through digital wallets. Second being change in the mechanism of dispensing 
   products. The new mechanism ensures uniform system for all sorts of products and 
   solves the problem of item getting stuck.

## Food Delivery App 
   A food delivery app that would allow students of bits goa to order food online from various
